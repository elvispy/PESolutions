# PE 160
# Idea: 
# Calculate the product of all numbers of the form 2^k 5^l * p, where p is odd.
# 1) First the cases when l >= k. Here, we only multiply by p, with p = 1, 3, 7, 9... 10^12/(2^k*5^l)
#    There are L=floor((10^12/5^l*2^k -1)/2) odd numbers, and floor(L/5) of them are multiple of 5. Call this number Q = Q(l, k)
# 2) There are (l-k) * Q multiples of two that have to be deleted. 
# 3) Now we analyze the k > l cases. Here we have to delete the multiples of two to match the multiples of five that were
