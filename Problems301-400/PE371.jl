# The idea is to use recursion: we classify plates as 
"""
1) Plates that have not been seen and wouldnt make me win if I were to see them
2) Plates that have not been seen and would   make me win if I were to see them
3) Plates that I have already seen and wouldnt make me win If I were to see them again
4) Plates that I have already seen and would make me win If I were to see them again (plate 500)

Let b be zero or one, corresponding to having seen plate #4. 
Let x be the number of plates in #3
Let y be the number of plates in #1

Then b + 2x + y + 1 = N

We have that
    E[X] = P(#1)(1 + E[X']) + P(#2) + P(#4) + P(#3)(1 + E[X])
         = 1 + P(#1) * E[X'] + P(#3) * E[X]
âˆ´ E[X] = (1 + P(#1) * E[X'])/(1 - P(#3))
